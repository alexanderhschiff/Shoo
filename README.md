# Shoo
When you’re presenting on an important video call, crying through the last episode of your favorite show, or napping after a late night, the last thing you want is to be interrupted. Sometimes, you need your housemates, roommates, dormmates – everyone, really – to just leave you alone. Shoo is the best way to stop interruptions.

Tell your mates to Shoo when you can’t be bothered. If you want, you can let them know what you're up to, how long you'll be busy, and even send notifications to your group to ensure peace and quiet. You can also say if you’re down to hang or send individual reminders when people forget that they’ve been told to Shoo.

Shoo was developed in May-June 2020 by Alexander and Benjamin Schiff, and [is available for free on the app store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1515029874 "App Store").

Feel free to browse and re-purpose any of our code. The front-end's built with SwiftUI, and the backend is powered by Firebase.
